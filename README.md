## Ultralytics Tutorial

Followed Ultralytics tutorial (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data) and trained yolov5x model on the coco128 dataset for 5 epochs. Then made predictions on a video I took of my street with cars, bikes and motorcycles. The result is pretty nice but there is still some noise in the predictions.
